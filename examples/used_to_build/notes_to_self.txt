then next, you need to count how many errors are needed to get to each alternative
state to the deterministic one.
Remember, you need to count errors from the deterministic destination (next_actions above),
not from the starting point (prev_actions above)
Use it to populate an epsilon-order matrix with zeros on the deterministic destination
and values above 0 elsewhere





# thoughts right now:
# - within the calculation of long-term payoff with fixed strategies,
#   I should be making "sensible" decisions like:
#   - definitely co-author a paper if doing so gives a positive co-authorship component
#   - definitely first-author a paper if doing so gives a
#     positive first-authorship component
# Only when faced with the possibility of not co-authoring should a player
# then turn to their strategy rules (all-c, all-d, pavlov, etc.)
#
# If I include first-authoring as a strategy, then for a 3 player system,
# I have 4096 possible actions all 3 could take. For a 2-player system, it's only 64,
# so start there.
# But I might be able to throw out a lot of the possibilities on the basis of
# the epsilon order.
